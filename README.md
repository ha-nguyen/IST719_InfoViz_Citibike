- Summary: Citi Bike is the largest public bike sharing program in the U.S, providing bicycles for shared use to individuals on a very short term basis. Since 2013, the program has collected a lot of information regarding to the people who ride, time when they ride, and how far they have been going. My goal is to help researchers and policy makers determine the effectiveness of the program, in term of riding activities and bike station usage over the year.

- Visualization process: I collected and processed 1GB cycling data for the year 2014, including over 8 million cycling activities of 6000 bicycles across 344 bike stations around various New York City neighborhoods. Using R and Adobe Illustrator, I created various types of plots, from time series plots, heat map, to density map and network graphs, to identify time and location where the activities were most active, as well as the demographics of ride users.

- Result: pdf file, including heat map to show riding activities across the year, density map to identify the most riding-active locations during the day, and network graph of bike stations to show how the bike stations connected
